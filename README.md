# Shortcut composer

**Extension** for painting application **Krita**, which allows to create custom, complex **keyboard shortcuts**.


The plugin adds new shortcuts of the following types:
- `Pie menu` - while key is pressed, displays a pie menu, which allows to pick values by hovering a mouse.
- `Cursor tracker` - while key is pressed, tracks a cursor, switching values according to cursor offset.
- `Canvas preview` - Temporarily changes canvas elements while the key is pressed.
- `Multiple assignment` - repeatedly pressing a key, cycles between multiple values of krita property.
- `Temporary key` - temporarily activates a krita property with long press or toggles it on/off with short press.

## What's new in v1.1.0
### Added
- Edit mode for PieMenus - click or drag the value icon to enter it. While in edit mode, the values can be dragged across the PieMenu to change their order.
- Action values tab in Configure Shortcut Composer for adding and removing values in PieMenus and MultipleAssignment actions.
- PieValues backtrounds are now animated.

### Fixed
- Allow scrolling through masks while using layey mouse trackers  
- Make sure that presets in PieMenu are displayed only once.
- Allow using "Enclose and fill" tool
- Fix icon of "Colorize Mask" tool

## Requirements
Shortcut Composer **v1.1.0** Requires krita **5.1.0** or later.

OS support state:
- [x] Windows 10/11
- [x] Linux
- [ ] MacOS (Known bug of canvas losing focus after using PieMenu)
- [ ] Android (Does not support python plugins yet)

## Installation:
1. on [github project page](https://github.com/wojtryb/Shortcut-Composer), click the green button <kbd>code</kbd> and pick the <kbd>download zip</kbd> option. Do not extract it.
2. in krita's topbar, open **Tools > Scripts > Import Python Plugin From File** and pick the downloaded .zip file
3. restart krita.
4. set custom shortcuts in **Settings > Configure Krita > Keyboard Shortcuts** under **Scripts > Shortcut Composer: Complex Actions** section. By intention, there are no default bindings.

## Pre-made actions
While Shortcut-Composer is highly configurable and extendable, the add-on comes with pre-made, plug-and-play actions.

### (`Pie menus`):
Pie menu is a widget displayed on the canvas while a key is pressed. It will disappear as soon, as the key is released. Moving cursor in a direction of a icon, activates its value on key release. **The action does not recognise mouse clicks, and only requires hovering**. Pie menu does nothing if the cursor is not moved out of the deadzone.

Dragging a value enters `Edit mode` in which the keyboard button no longer needs to be pressed. In this mode values can be dragged accross the widget to change their order. When done, press the tick button to apply the changes. 

- ### Pick brush presets (red, green, blue)
  Three color coded pie menus that let you pick a **brush preset** from related **tag** with brush presets. Used tags can be changed in **Tools > Scripts > Configure Shortcut Composer**. Default tag mapping is as follows:
  - <span style="color:red">red</span>: "â˜… My Favorites"
  - <span style="color:green">green</span>: "RGBA"
  - <span style="color:blue">blue</span>: "Erasers"

  Presets in edited tags do not reload by themselves. Use **Tools > Scripts > Reload Shortcut Composer** or press apply/ok button in plugin configuration dialog.

- ### Pick misc tools
  Pie menu for picking **active tools**. Includes tools that are used rather sporadically, and may not be worth a dedicated keyboard shortcut each:
  - crop tool,
  - reference tool,
  - gradient tool,
  - multi_brush tool,
  - assistant tool
  
- ### Pick painting blending modes
  Pie menu for picking **painting blending modes**. Consists of most commonly used ones:
  - normal
  - overlay,
  - color,
  - multiply,
  - add,
  - screen,
  - darken,
  - lighten
  
### (`Cursor trackers`):
Cursor tracker is an action for switching values using cursor movement, while the keyboard key is pressed. It changes a single krita property according to the cursor movement along horizontal or vertical axis. **The action does not recognise mouse clicks, and only requires hovering**

- ### Scroll isolated layers
  Scrolls the layers by sliding the cursor vertically. Can be used for picking the active layer and analizing the layer stack. While the key is pressed, isolates the active layer to give better response of which layer is active.
  - Key press: isloate active layer
  - Horizontal: -
  - Vertical: scroll all layers

- ### Scroll timeline or animated layers
  Variation on "Scroll isolated layers" for animators. Scrolling is restricted only to layers pinned to the animation timeline. Horizontal mouse movement changes the current frame.
  - Key press: isloate active layer
  - Horizontal: scroll animation frames
  - Vertical: scroll layers pinned to timeline

- ### Scroll undo stack
  Extends the krita undo action <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd>. While the key is pressed, horizontal mouse movement controls the undo stack by performing undo and redo actions. Usual undo with short key press is still possible.
  - Key press: undo last operation
  - Horizontal: scroll left to undo, or right to redo
  - Vertical: -

- ### Scroll brush size or opacity
  Allows to control both `brush size` or `opacity` with a single key. Opacity changes contiguously with vertical mouse movement, while brush size snaps to custom values.
  - Key press: -
  - Horizontal: scroll brush size (descrete)
  - Vertical: scroll painting opacity (contiguous)

- ### Scroll canvas zoom or rotation
  Allows to control both `canvas zoom` or `canvas rotation` with a single key. Does not block the ability to paint.
  - Key press: -
  - Horizontal: canvas rotation (contiguous)
  - Vertical: canvas zoom (contiguous)

### (`Canvas previews`):
Canvas preview is an action which changes canvas elements when the key is pressed, and changes them back to their original state on key release.

- ### Preview current layer visibility
  Changes active layer visibility on key press and release. Allows to quickly check layer's content.

- ### Preview projection below
  Hides all visible layers above the active one on key press, and reverses this change on key release. Allows to check what is the position of current layer in a stack. It is possible to paint while action is active.

### (`Multiple assignments`):
Multiple assignment is an action which cycles between multiple values of single krita property. Each key press activates next list element. Performing a long press breaks the cycle and sets a default value, which does not have to belong the the list.

- ### Cycle selection tools
  Pressing a key repeatedly cycles most commonly used selection tools:
  - freehand selection tool,
  - rectangular selection tool,
  - contiguous selection tool

  Performing a long press, goes back to the `freehand brush tool`. Tools can be used while the key is pressed.

- ### Cycle painting opacity
  Pressing a key repeatedly cycles brush predefined opacity values: `100%`, `70%`, `50%`, `30%`

  Performing a long press, goes back to the `100%` opacity. Modified opacity can be used while the key is pressed.

### (`Temporary keys`):
- ### Temporary move tool
  Pressing a key temporarily activates the `move tool` which goes back to the `freehand brush tool` after the key release. Short key presses allow to permanently toggle between those two tools. 

- ### Temporary eraser
  Pressing a key temporarily activates the `eraser` mode which gets turned off after the key is released. Short key presses allow to permanently toggle between those two states. 

- ### Temporary preserve alpha
  Pressing a key temporarily activates the `preserve alpha` mode which gets turned off after the key is released. Short key presses allow to permanently toggle between those two states. 

## Modifying default plugin behaviour

### Tweaking the global parameters
Shortcut-Composer comes with a settings dialog available from krita topbar: **Tools > Scripts > Configure Shortcut Composer**. The dialog allows to change the following aspects of actions:

- Preset pie-menus mapping
  - `Tag (red)` - tag to be used in red preset pie-menu
  - `Tag (green)` - tag to be used in green preset pie-menu
  - `Tag (blue)` - tag to be used in blue preset pie-menu
- Common settings
  - `Short vs long press time` - Time in seconds distinguishing short key presses from long ones.
  - `FPS limit` - Maximum rate of Mouse Tracker and Pie Menu refresh.
- Cursor trackers
  - `Tracker sensitivity scale` - Sensitivity multiplier of all Mouse Trackers. 
  - `Tracker deadzone` - Amount of pixels a mouse needs to moved for Mouse Trackers to start work.
- Pie menus display
  - `Pie global scale` - Global scale factor for base of every pie menu.
  - `Pie icon global scale` - Global scale factor for icons of every pie menu.
  - `Pie deadzone global scale` - Global scale factor for the deadzone area of every pie menu.
  - `Pie animation time` - Time (in seconds) for fade-in animation when showing the pie menu.

### Changing the values in Pie menus and Multiple assignments
**Configure Shortcut Composer** has a separate tab called `Action values` in which you can add new values to some of the actions, as well as remove those that are not needed.

Action to modify can be selected using the combobox on the top.

Values are added by selecting the list value(s) on the left and pressing the green **add** button. Analogically, selecting values on the right, and pressing the **remove** button, removes the values from action.

Dragging values on the right, allow to change their order. This can also be done using the `Edit mode` directly from the PieMenu (does not apply to MultipleAssignments) 


### Modifying actions and creating custom ones
While the settings dialog allows to tweak the values common for plugin actions, it does not allow to modify the behaviour of the actions or create new ones.

To achieve that it is required to modify actions implementation: 
- in krita's topbar, open **Settings > Manage Resources > Open Resource Folder**
- navigate to **./pykrita/shortcut_composer/** directory.
- action definitions are located in `actions.action` file.
- actions implementation is located in `actions.py` file.

1. Define an action in `actions.action` file by duplicating one of the existing definitions and using an unique name for it.
2. Implement an action in `actions.py` file. Once again, duplicate one of the existing implementations. It is best to pick the one that feels closest to desired action. Fill its arguments, making sure the name is exactly the same as defined earlier.
 
## Worth noting
- Key bindings with modifiers like <kbd>ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>shift</kbd> are supported. When assigned to a key combination, the key is considered released when the main key in sequence (non-modifier) is released.
- Multiple shortcuts from this plugin can be used at the same time, unless bindings make it technically impossible. For example holding both keys for `Temporary eraser` and `Cycle painting opacity` result in an eraser with 70% opacity.

### Known limitations
- Pressing a modifier while the usual key is pressed, will result in conflict. For instance, pressing <kbd>ctrl</kbd> while using temporary eraser assigned to <kbd>x</kbd> will result in unwanted <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> operation which cuts current layer.

## For krita plugin programmers
### Alternative API
The extension consists of elements that can be reused in other krita plugins under GPL-3.0-or-later license. Package `api_krita` wrappes krita api offering PEP8 compatibility, typings, and docstring documentation. Most of objects attributes are now available as settables properties.

Copy `api_krita` to the extension directory, to access syntax such as:
```python
from .api_krita import Krita
from .api_krita.enums import BlendingMode, Tool, Toggle

# active tool operations
tool = Krita.active_tool  # get current tool
Krita.active_tool = Tool.FREEHAND_BRUSH  # set current tool
Tool.FREEHAND_BRUSH.activate()  # set current tool (alternative way)

# operations on a document
document = Krita.get_active_document()
all_nodes = document.get_all_nodes()  # all nodes with flattened structure
picked_node = all_nodes[3]

picked_node.name = "My layer name"
picked_node.visible = True
picked_node.opacity = 50  # remapped from 0-255 go 0-100 [%]
document.active_node = picked_node 
document.refresh()

# Operations on a view
view = Krita.get_active_view()
view.brush_size = 100
view.blending_mode = BlendingMode.NORMAL  # Enumerated blending modes

# Handling checkable actions
mirror_state = Toggle.MIRROR_CANVAS.state  # get mirror state
Toggle.SOFT_PROOFING.state = False  # turn off soft proofing
Toggle.PRESERVE_ALPHA.switch_state()  # change state of preserve alpha
```

Only functionalities that were needed during this plugin development are wrapped, so some of them are not yet available. The syntax can also change over time.

### Custom keyboard shortcut interface
Package `input_adapter` consists of `ActionManager` and `ComplexAction` which grants extended interface for creating keyboard shortcuts.

While usual actions can only recognise key press, subclassing `ComplexAction` lets you override methods performed on:
- key press
- short key release
- long key release
- every key release

Then use `ActionManager` instance to bind objects of those custom actions to krita during CreateActions phase:

```python
from api_krita import Extension
from input_adapter import ActionManager, ComplexAction


class CustomAction(ComplexAction):
    def on_key_press(self): ...
    def on_short_key_release(self): ...
    def on_long_key_release(self): ...
    def on_every_key_release(self): ...


class ExtensionName(Extension):
    ...
    def createActions(self, window) -> None:
        action = CustomAction(name="Custom action name")
        self.manager = ActionManager(window)
        self.manager.bind_action(action)
```
