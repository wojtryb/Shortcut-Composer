    Grants interface to track progress of two-way steep animation.

    Holds the state of animation as float in range <0-1> which can be
    obtained with `value` property.

    Animation state can be altered with `up()` and `down()` methods.
    The change is the fastest when the animation starts, and then slows
    down near the end (controlled by `steep` argument).

    There is a `reset()` method to cancel the animation immediately.
