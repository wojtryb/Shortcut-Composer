    ```python
    assert Edible.APPLE in Edible._fruit
    assert Edible.TOMATO in Edible._groups_["Vegetable"]
    ```

    Groups are class attributes, but they are not Enum members - they
    will not be part of `_member_map_`.

    Every `Enum` member belongs to exactly one group. Every subclass must
    start with a group separator. Otherwise, exception will be raised
    during class creation.
